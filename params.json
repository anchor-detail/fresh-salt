But it's faster than loading the [WordPress Secret Key Generator](https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt/) and copying the results manually.\r\n\r\nSince I deal with *at least* a couple exploited WordPress sites a week — and regenerating the keys is always a part of my cleanup workflow — I'm sort of scratching my own itch here. And while I'm not sure if anyone else will find this useful, I still figure that it's worth sharing.\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\n[Icon](http://sensibleworld.com/news/salt-shaker-icon-131/) courtesy of Jory Raphael at Sensible World.\r\n","google":"UA-42091392-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
