# Fresh Salt

Copy freshly generated WordPress security keys to your clipboard.

## Installation

Download [Fresh Salt](https://raw.github.com/boogah/fresh-salt/master/Fresh%20Salt.alfredworkflow) and double-click to import it into [Alfred 2](http://www.alfredapp.com).

## Usage

* In Alfred, type `wpsalt` and hit `ENTER`.
* Paste the security keys wherever you might need to put them.

## Release Notes

Listen, it's just a stupid cURL request & pbcopy. But it's faster than loading the [WordPress Secret Key Generator](https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt/) and copying the results.
